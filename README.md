# Mock-Linux-File-System
This is a project that creates a mock Linux file system with a mock Linux shell that stores file in memory.  

This system allows you either create .txt or .img file using touch command and using cat command to edit the file afterwards.  

We are working to build additional macrocommands to enable faster creation and execution.  

Use help to get a list of additional commands available.
